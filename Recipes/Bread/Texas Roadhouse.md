## Ingredients
### Dough
- 1 1/2 cup Whole Milk
- 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
- 1/4 oz packet or 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 3 large eggs, beaten to blend
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 4 tsp kosher salt
- 6 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- Oil for greasing
- 
### Cinnamon-Honey Butter & Assembly
- 1 tbsp confectioners sugar
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 3/4 cup unsalter butter, softened
- Flaky sea salt (optional)

## Directions
### Dough
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until warm to the touch, between 100° to 110°. In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine warm milk, granulated sugar, and yeast. Let sit until yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Add eggs, butter, and kosher salt and beat on low speed until just combined. Add flour and continue to beat on low speed until dough comes together, about 5 minutes.
3. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Return dough to lightly floured surface and roll to a 1"-thick rectangle. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 2" squares. Transfer squares to prepared sheets, spacing about 1/2" apart. Cover each sheet with a dish towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

### Cinnamon-Honey Butter & Assembly
1. In a large bowl, whisk confectioners’ sugar, honey, kosher salt, cinnamon, and 1 stick butter until thoroughly combined and fluffy.
2. Preheat oven to 375°. Melt remaining 1/2 stick butter in the microwave or in a small pot. Brush each square with butter.
3. Bake rolls until golden brown and risen, about 15 minutes.
4. Brush rolls with more melted butter and sprinkle with sea salt, if using. Serve with cinnamon-honey butter alongside.
