# Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup honey
* 3 tablespoons molasses
* 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 2 1/2 cups bread flour, or more as needed
* 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, or more as needed
* 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 to 2 tablespoons cornmeal, for the pan

# Steps
1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Combine the warm water, brown sugar, honey, and molasses in a measuring cup. Add the yeast to the top and allow it to soften in the warm water, about 5 minutes.
3. Add yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer, once it has softened. Add in the salt, canola oil, bread flour, whole wheat flour, and cocoa powder. Mix together with the hook attachment until the ingredients are just combined. Scrape down the bowl looking for any flour pockets to incorporate.
4. Mix with the dough hook attachment on medium speed for 5 to 10 minutes, adding more bread or whole wheat flour if necessary, until a ball of dough forms. It should be just slightly sticky to the touch. It should not leave residue on fingers. It should feel elastic and will bounce back when touched. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and set aside to rise.
5. Punch down the dough, once it has risen to double its size (about one hour), and form it into a ball.
6. Cut the ball of dough into 8 equally sized balls.
7. Roll each ball into a rectangle, about a 1/4 inch thick.
8. Roll up the rectangle into a log and press the ends under and place the seam side down on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
9. Place all of the logs onto a baking sheet that is coated with cornmeal. Then cover the rolls with a towel. Allow to rise for 20 minutes in a warm place. Preheat the oven to 400F.
10. Once they have risen again, bake in the preheated oven for 14 to 18 minutes.
11. Remove the rolls from the oven when they are puffy and browned and have a slight crust. Allow them to cool. Serve with whipped butter.

# Tips
* To achieve the fluffy and slightly chewy texture of the bread it is essential to knead for at least 5 minutes. This works best with a dough hook on a stand mixer for a sweet, sticky bread like this because you won't have to add as much flour to it. The kneading helps the glutens form and creates elasticity.
* You don't have to use bread flour but it definitely creates the best texture.
* If you can, let the bread rise in a warm place. This will help it rise faster and more efficiently.
* You can heat your oven to 100 F to create a warm environment.
* If your oven doesn't have a "proof" setting, place the covered bowl of dough in the oven and turn the oven light on. Or place the covered bowl of dough on the upper rack in the oven and a pan with about 3 cups of boiling water on the lower rack.

# Storage
* Store the loaves in an airtight container or zip*close food storage bags at room temperature for up to three days. Just make sure they are cooled first so they donâ€™t have condensation.
* You can also freeze the rolls. Wait until they have cooled and then place them in a plastic freezer bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 6 months. When you are ready to heat, preheat your oven to 400 and bake for about 5 minutes or until heated through.
